# Reinforcement-Learning-DQN

This is an implementation about DQN Paper, With OpenAI envoirements.

DQN (Deep Q Network) is a Deep Mind's paper based in Q-Learning.

## Q-Learning
This algorithm learns the Q(s,a) functions (Action - Value) how good is the action for a specify state.
In Q-Learning we biuld a table with each possible Q-value for each state(s) and action(a) and Q-value is an float value that we define like the matematical hope to get a Reward(r) take an Action(a) in the State(s). So, If we sample an Action(a) find a Reward(r) and new State(s'), we want determinate the Action(a') that maximize Q(s,a).
